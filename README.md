# HotPlaykey
A singular executable made with Python which plays selected audio file by pressing a hotkey. A prototype version was made by only me with simple code with only a console and no tkinter usage. 
But a lotta stuff was improvised and added by AI which was changed a bit to what my random users might see.

- first of all: yes you can change a hotkey to your likings
- second of all: not all audio files are supported for a program due to `just_playback` limitations
- thats all lmao
