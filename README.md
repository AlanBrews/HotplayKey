# HotPlaykey
An ordinary audio player which only plays music by pressing a hotkey: "menu" (you can change it)
A player relies on `just_playback` library, which **doesn't support most of the audio file types!**

The program's prototype was made by only me with simple code with only a console and no tkinter usage. 
But a lotta stuff was improvised and added which was changed to what my random users might see.
