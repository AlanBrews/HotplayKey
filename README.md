# HotPlaykey
A singular executable made with Python which plays selected audio file by pressing a hotkey. It runs on background, just don't close it. A default hotkey is set to "menu"

A prototype version was made by only me with simple code with only a console and no tkinter usage. But a lotta stuff was improvised and added by AI which was changed a bit to what my random users might see.

- first of all: yes you can change a hotkey to your likings
- second of all: not all audio files are supported for a program due to `just_playback` limitations
- thats all lmao

(if you read this this repository isnt finished)
